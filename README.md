# DataCamp-Project-Project-What-s-in-a-Name

In this project, we will explore a rich dataset of first names of babies born in the US, 
that spans a period of more than 100 years! 
This suprisingly simple dataset can help us uncover so many interesting stories, 
and that is exactly what we are going to be doing. 

The purpose of this project is to practice pandas.
